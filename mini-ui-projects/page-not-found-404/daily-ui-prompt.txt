Prompt: 404 Page Design

Design a 404 page - that's not boring!
Does it suit the brand's style? Is it user-friendly? It might sound mundane, but not everything can be flashy or glamorous. 
Every day millions of people will be landing on 404 pages.
You have an opportunity to help them in a way that's useful and aesthetically pleasing. (It's up to you!)
