Prompt: Invoice

Invoices are generally sent for products or services before or after fulfillment. 
For example, a web designer or software engineer might send an invoice for a new website with 25% as a down payment and the remainder on completion.
This is not a quote or proposal, so it should have only the required information for payment, 
services rendered, prices, etc. and ideally a link/button to receive payment.

Tip: An invoice is a nice opportunity to thank a client. Uplifting comments can put clients in a good mood.
If you know them in a personal/friendly context, sometimes a meme can help break the ice on making a payment. :)
